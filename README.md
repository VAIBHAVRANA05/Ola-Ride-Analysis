üöó OLA Data Analyst Project ‚Äì Presented by Vaibhav Rana
This project focuses on analyzing OLA ride data using SQL to extract insights and answer key business questions. The dataset simulates real-world ride-sharing data for Bengaluru, India, covering booking statuses, ride distances, cancellations, and ratings. Through SQL queries, I explored customer behavior, operational metrics, and driver performance, providing a comprehensive view of OLA‚Äôs ride operations.

üõ† SQL Analysis and Queries
Key Business Questions Answered:
Retrieve all successful bookings:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE Booking_Status = 'Success';
Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Vehicle_Type, AVG(Ride_Distance) AS avg_distance FROM bookings GROUP BY Vehicle_Type;
Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings WHERE Booking_Status = 'Cancelled by Customer';
List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Customer_ID, COUNT(Booking_ID) AS total_rides FROM bookings GROUP BY Customer_ID ORDER BY total_rides DESC LIMIT 5;
Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT MAX(Driver_Ratings) AS max_rating, MIN(Driver_Ratings) AS min_rating FROM bookings WHERE Vehicle_Type = 'Prime Sedan';
Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT SUM(Booking_Value) AS total_successful_value FROM bookings WHERE Booking_Status = 'Success';
üéØ Key Insights and Findings
62% of bookings were successful, with weekends showing a higher ride volume and booking value.
Customer cancellations accounted for only 7%, with most citing incorrect pickup locations or change of plans.
Driver cancellations were higher at 18%, commonly due to personal reasons or vehicle issues.
Prime Sedan bookings had the most consistent driver ratings, with an average rating of 4.5/5.
Top 5 customers contributed to 15% of the total booking value, indicating frequent usage patterns.

Ride Volume Over Time ‚Äì Daily and weekly trends in ride bookings.
Booking Status Breakdown ‚Äì Distribution of successful, cancelled, and incomplete rides.
Revenue by Payment Method ‚Äì Analysis of revenue generated from different payment modes.
Driver and Customer Ratings ‚Äì Distribution and correlation between customer and driver ratings.
