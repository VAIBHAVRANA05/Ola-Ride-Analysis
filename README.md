# ðŸš— OLA Data Analyst Project â€“ Presented by Vaibhav Rana  

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of OLA ride data. The objective is to derive meaningful insights related to ride patterns, customer behavior, and operational performance. Using SQL, Iâ€™ve answered key business questions and demonstrated how to analyze large datasets to solve real-world problems in the ride-sharing industry.
