🚖 Ola Ride Analysis Using SQL
📌 Overview
Welcome to my Ola Ride Analysis project! This project leverages SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze Ola ride data, providing key insights into customer behavior, ride patterns, cancellations, driver performance, and financial metrics.

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate the practical application of SQL queries in solving real-world business challenges in the ride-sharing industry.

🔍 Objectives
This project focuses on answering important business questions using SQL, such as:
✅ Retrieve all successful bookings to understand the completion rate.
✅ Calculate the average ride distance for different vehicle types.
✅ Analyze ride cancellations by both customers and drivers, identifying common reasons.
✅ Identify the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides.
✅ Find driver-related cancellations, distinguishing between personal and vehicle-related issues.
✅ Analyze driver performance by retrieving maximum and minimum ratings for Prime Sedan rides.
✅ List incomplete rides and categorize them based on the reason for incompletion.
✅ Retrieve all rides paid via UPI to analyze digital payment trends.
✅ Calculate the total booking value of successfully completed rides.
✅ Find the average customer rating for different vehicle types.

💡 Why This Project?
